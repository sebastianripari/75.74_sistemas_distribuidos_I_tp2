Depending on the situation any of us can just take a second and reset the declination on our own little moral compasses to justify whatever we want to do in the moment.Ethical? Probably not.

Anyways, 😂 I 👁 don't 🚫 care 💅 for 🍆 sugar 🍚 free 💜 anything, 😯 am 👏 not 🚫 afraid 💀 of 💦 getting 💦 diarrhea (I'm 💘 usually 😌 constipated anyways) 😂 and 👏 have 👏 always 🔥 been 👏 amused with 👏 having 👬 excess flatulence. So, 💯 to 💦 start 🔘 with...the taste. 👅 I 👁 think 💭 the 👏 taste 👅 of 💦 anything 😯 and 👏 everything 💯 'sugar free' kind 🙁 of 💦 sucks 👎 no 🙅 matter 🙅 what 😦 but 🍑 I 👁 must 👫 admit, these 👈 actually 😳 weren't 😡 that 😐 bad. 👎 The 👏 pineapple 🍍 ones 💚 were 👶 the 👏 best, 👌 I 👁 thought, 💭 and 👏 the 👏 lemon 🍋 ones 💚 were 👶 my 👨 least 💯 favorite. 📑 I 👁 only 🕦 noticed 🙀 an 👹 aftertaste from 👉 the 👏 aspartame after 👀 I 👁 stopped 🏽 eating 👅 them 💦 and 👏 even 🌃 then, 😮 it 💯 wasn't 😐 as 🍑 bad 👎 as 🍑 from 👉 a 👌 diet 🍷 soda 🍺 or 💁 what 😦 not. 🚫 I 👁 started 💢 off 📴 eating 👅 about 💦 20 🔳 of 💦 them. 💦 I 👁 had 💋 a 👌 normal 😐 BM about 💦 2 🕝 hours 🕐 later, 🕑 nothing 🚫 out 💯 of 💦 the 👏 ordinary.
